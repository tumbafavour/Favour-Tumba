I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the late submission of my recent assignments for your CSC 312 class. I understand the importance of adhering to deadlines, and I deeply regret any inconvenience my delay may have caused.

I encountered challenges in completing the assignment on time. Despite my best efforts to meet the deadline, I underestimated the time required to address these issues effectively.

I take full responsibility for my actions, and I understand the importance of punctuality in an academic setting. I assure you that I have taken steps to prevent such delays in the future. I have learned from this experience and will make every effort to submit assignments on time going forward.

I kindly request your understanding and would be grateful if you could consider my assignment for grading. I understand if any late penalties apply, and I am willing to accept the consequences of my actions.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me via email or during your office hours.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Tumba Favour
